##  Cleaning Up Old Vestal Files

Once you've verified Engram works, you can safely delete the old Vestal folder:

### Option 1: Via File Explorer
1. Navigate to: `C:\Users\kirst\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\`
2. Delete the `Vestalrepository` folder

### Option 2: Via PowerShell
```powershell
Remove-Item -Path "C:\Users\kirst\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Vestalrepository" -Recurse -Force
```

** IMPORTANT**: Test Engram first before deleting Vestal!
